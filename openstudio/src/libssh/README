libssh: the SSH library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1* Why ?
-_-_-_-_-_

Why not ? :) I've began to work on my own implementation of the ssh protocol
because i didn't like the currently public ones.
Not any allowed you to import and use the functions as a powerful library, 
and so i worked on a library-based SSH implementation which was non-existing
in the free and open source software world.


2* How/Who ?
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

If you downloaded this file, you must know what it is : a library for
accessing ssh client services through C libraries calls in a simple manner.
Everybody can use this software under the terms of the LGPL - see the COPYING
file

If you ask yourself how to compile libssh, please read INSTALL before anything.

3* Where ?
-_-_-_-_-_-_

http://www.libssh.org

4* API Changes !
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

Changes between 0.3 and 0.4
---------------------------

We changed libssh to be typesafe now:

SSH_SESSION *session -> ssh_session session
SFTP_SESSION *sftp -> sftp_session sftp
CHANNEL *channel -> ssh_channel channel
STRING *string -> ssh_string string
...

The options structure has been removed and there is a new function. This
function can set all available options now. You can find the enum in the
header file and it is documented. Example:

ssh_options_set(session, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");
